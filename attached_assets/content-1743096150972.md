# Insights Discovery Colour Energies: A Beginners Guide

A Beginners Guide

## What is your preferred Insights Discovery Colour Energy?

Follow this guide to find out how Insights Discovery can transform teams and leaders through an understanding of the four Colour Energies.

### The Benefits of the Insights Colour Model

One of the main benefits of the Insights Discovery Model is its accessibility – the Insights Colours are so easy to grasp and recognise in the everyday behaviours displayed by those around you. The Discovery Colour Model also benefits from its memorability – enabling behaviour to remain front-of-brain in our efforts to get the best out of ourselves and those with whom we come into contact.

### Working With the Colour Energies

Recognising the Insights Discovery colour energies in others is only part of the battle – adapting your own behaviour to better meet others’ needs is the key. So here’s a handy guide to remind you of the basics when preparing for and executing that critical performance review meeting to ensure that feedback is delivered respectfully and received well:

###### Red Energy

##### Preparation

Have clear objectives in mind and be prepared to share them. Have a concise overview of the area of under-performance that needs addressing.

##### Environment

Keep it formal and business-like.

##### Communication

Get to the point without waffle or trying to ‘pad’ the bad news. Link performance to success criteria and emphasise what success would mean to them.

###### Yellow Energy

##### Preparation

Allow plenty of time to talk things through. Have clear examples of the under performance as evidence.

##### Environment

Casual and informal – maybe out of the office in a cafe or coffee shop.

##### Communication

Frame the issue within the wider picture and use stories to illustrate the under-performance. Acknowledge and praise areas where performance has been good. Watch out for blame being passed. Use Humour.

###### Green Energy

##### Preparation

Don’t expect buy-in to be complete after one meeting. Consider the impact on the wider team as a result of the under-performance. If possible, provide some information up-front so that they have time to reflect on what you have to say before they respond.

##### Environment

Relaxed and comfortable, if possible over coffee, and not across a desk. Somewhere quiet and private is best.

##### Communication

Take it slowly and allow time for a response. Frame the issue sensitively and avoid allocating blame. Stress the benefits to the team as a whole.

###### Blue Energy

##### Preparation

Be well prepared and factual. Ensure that you have enough evidence to support your claims of under-performance and that these are based in logic and fact. Use actual examples to demonstrate the issues. Provide a written agenda with plenty of information before the meeting.

##### Environment

Formal and correct, demonstrating competence, orderliness and professionalism. Somewhere quiet and private, away from prying eyes.

##### Communication

Present the facts in an orderly and timely manner. Have the information written down for analysis later on. Allow for periods of silence and reflection.

### The Insights Discovery Colour Energies Under Stress

However much we may try to adapt our behaviours to connect better with colleagues, other stress-inducing events are out of our control. Our colleagues, like us, can succumb to these pressures by behaving in unhelpful and, at times, inappropriate ways. By recognising what causes stress in each colour energy and what signals will be visible, you can implement solutions to minimise the disruption – see below:

### How to use our Colour Insights

**Do:**

1. Treat everyone as a unique individual – remembering we are a blend of ALL the colour energies – not just one.
2. Be mindful of other factors in an individual’s life which could affect their choices – take a holistic approach where necessary.
3. Identify, and draw attention to, the difference between your opinions (or personal judgements) – and facts.
4. Keep your input as general as possible – it’s easy to prejudice others’ opinions. Far better to ask more questions than you answer.
5. Jung said “Every individual is an exception to the rule”. Understand and allow for this.
6. Remember this is a behavioural model – it is about preference, not capability. It is not a measure of skill or intelligence. It describes but does not define.

**Don’t:**

1. Box anyone in – ever!
2. ‘Diagnose’ or interpret ‘facts’ using the colours. The expert is the individual.
3. Make suppositions about a given colour spread.
4. Use the colours in a belittling or pejorative way – or ‘hide’ behind your own colour spread (e.g. just because you have Blue as least preferred, doesn’t mean you ‘can’t’ do a spreadsheet!).
5. Restrict anyone’s ability to have transcended their behavioural preferences by experience, education and perseverance.
6. Say someone is ‘wrong’ or demean their choice of colour spread (even to someone else) or tell someone what colour you believe they are before they have chosen for themselves.
