Write a self-contained Python 3 script (single file) that recreates the DISC “bullseye” competency wheel shown in the attached image.

REQUIREMENTS

Use only matplotlib (no seaborn, plotly, etc.).

Canvas size: 8 × 8 in, equal aspect.

Structure:
• 8 equal 45° wedges labelled, clockwise from the top:
“REFORMER”, “DIRECTOR”, “MOTIVATOR”, “INSPIRER”,
“HELPER”, “SUPPORTER”, “COORDINATOR”, “OBSERVER”.

Label text sits on the coloured outer rim, curved along the arc.
Rim colours (hex):
Reformer #AF6BAA, Director #E15736, Motivator #F28E2B, Inspirer #F1C84C,
Helper #D5D95D, Supporter #7EB758, Coordinator #1B8673, Observer #4576A8.
Concentric rings:
• 4 radii → 3 gray “score” bands plus the white centre.
• Alternate gray/white fill starting with light-gray (#ECECEC) for the outermost band.
• Bold black circle outlines at each radius.

Radial guides:
• Solid black lines on the 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° axes.
• Dashed black guides at 22.5° increments (i.e., the bisectors of each wedge).

Cell numbers:
• Load the 4 × 8 integer grid below and place each number centred in its cell:

data = [
    [  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8],   # outermost ring
    [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 108, 109, 112],   # second ring
    [121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 128, 129, 132],   # third ring
    [141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 148, 149, 152]    # innermost score ring
]
Central DISC quartered circle: four equal quadrants (top-left blue #2B70B6, top-right red #E13A3E, bottom-left green #9BB53C, bottom-right yellow #F4D35E) with a thin black outline.

Two miniature pie charts:
• First pie: centre at polar (θ = 22.5°, r ≈ 0.55 × max) with 4 slices [0.35, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15] and matching blue/red/green/yellow colours; draw a black 1-pt outline around each wedge.
• Second pie: centre at polar (θ = 67.5°, r ≈ 0.85 × max) with slices [0.45, 0.30, 0.15, 0.10] and same colours.

Automatically hide axes, ticks, and frame.

Save figure to “disc_wheel.png”.

Be sure to:

Build polar coordinates manually with matplotlib.patches.Wedge for full control.
Wrap repetitive wedge drawing in helper functions.
Keep code under 150 lines and include clear inline comments.
Put all magic numbers (radii, colours, labels) as named constants at the top.
