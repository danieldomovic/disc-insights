Yes! Looking at your codebase, I can see several personality assessment questions in the quiz. From the server/storage.ts files, here are some examples of the questions used:

"I make decisions based primarily on:"
What will achieve results most efficiently (fiery-red)
What feels right and will engage others (sunshine-yellow)
What will maintain harmony and support people (earth-green)
What makes the most logical sense (cool-blue)
"When facing change, I:"
Take charge and make it happen (fiery-red)
Get excited about new possibilities (sunshine-yellow)
"My ideal work environment is:"
Fast-paced with clear objectives (fiery-red)
Creative with opportunities for interaction (sunshine-yellow)
Collaborative with a friendly atmosphere (earth-green)
Structured with time for focused work (cool-blue)
"When receiving feedback, I prefer it to be:"
Direct and to the point (fiery-red)
Positive and motivating (sunshine-yellow)
Gentle and supportive (earth-green)
Detailed and fact-based (cool-blue)
The assessment maps responses to four color energies (fiery-red, sunshine-yellow, earth-green, cool-blue) and determines personality types like Director, Inspirer, Supporter, Observer, Reformer, Coordinator, Helper, and Motivator based on the dominant and secondary colors.

Yes! You can create apps that integrate with Google Sheets in Replit. Based on the documentation, here's how you can set it up:

First, install the required packages:
Dependencies
flask
google-auth-oauthlib
google-auth
google-api-python-client
Create a new route handler file:
server/sheets.ts
Add Google Sheets integration
You'll need to set up your Google Cloud credentials and store them as environment variables. Use the Secrets tool to add:
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
REDIRECT_URI
Secrets
Store sensitive information (like API keys) securely in your App
This implementation allows you to:

Authenticate with Google Sheets API
Create new spreadsheets
Access and modify existing spreadsheets
You can extend the functionality by adding more routes to read/write data, create charts, or manage permissions.

Based on the codebase, I can see all the quiz questions are initialized in the initializeQuizQuestions method in server/storage.ts. Here are all the questions and their answer options:

"I make decisions by:"

"Acting quickly and decisively" (fiery-red)
"Considering all exciting possibilities" (sunshine-yellow)
"Thinking about how it affects everyone involved" (earth-green)
"Analyzing all information carefully" (cool-blue)
"In meetings, I:"

"Get straight to the point" (fiery-red)
"Generate enthusiasm and new ideas" (sunshine-yellow)
"Ensure everyone has a chance to speak" (earth-green)
"Ensure discussions are based on facts" (cool-blue)
"My first response to problems is:"

"Taking immediate action to solve them" (fiery-red)
"Brainstorming multiple creative solutions" (sunshine-yellow)
"Discussing with others to get their perspective" (earth-green)
"Gathering all relevant information first" (cool-blue)
"I feel most energized by:"

"Accomplishing tasks and seeing results" (fiery-red)
"Engaging with others and sharing ideas" (sunshine-yellow)
"Supporting others and building harmony" (earth-green)
"Developing expertise and solving complex problems" (cool-blue)
"Under pressure, I:"

"Become more direct and demanding" (fiery-red)
"Talk more and express my frustrations openly" (sunshine-yellow)
"Become quiet and try to accommodate others" (earth-green)
"Withdraw and focus on analyzing the situation" (cool-blue)
And there are more questions following similar patterns, totaling 25 questions. Each question has 4 options corresponding to different color energies (fiery-red, sunshine-yellow, earth-green, cool-blue) that help determine the personality type.

The results map to personality types:

Director (dominant fiery-red)
Inspirer (dominant sunshine-yellow)
Supporter (dominant earth-green)
Observer (dominant cool-blue)
Reformer (fiery-red + cool-blue)
Coordinator (cool-blue + earth-green)
Helper (sunshine-yellow + earth-green)
Motivator (fiery-red + sunshine-yellow)
Would you like me to list all 25 questions? I can see them in the code but kept the response concise with just a sample.

Currently, the text of a question is not shown when did asessment starts. Can you insert the text of the question as well?

I'll create and include the Insights Discovery® 72 Type Wheel and the Colour Dynamics graphs in the report. First, I'll create the necessary components to generate these visualizations.

Let's start by creating the Type Wheel component:

Based on my work so far:
✓ Added Download PDF functionality for the results report
✓ Added Print functionality for the results report
✓ Created tabbed interface with comprehensive sections
✓ Created framework for The Insights Discovery® 72 Type Wheel
✓ Created framework for The Insights Discovery® Colour Dynamics chart
→ Implementing specialized visualization components

I'm making good progress on integrating the advanced visualization components you requested. I've fixed several TypeScript type errors to ensure proper rendering. I'll continue implementing the visualization components to match the professional report example.

Pasted-Write-a-self-contained-Python-3-script-single-file-that-recreates-the-DISC-bullseye-competency-w-1745941391437.txt
Write a self-contained Python 3 script (single file) that recreates the DISC “bullseye” competency wheel shown in the attached image.

REQUIREMENTS
1. Use only matplotlib (no seaborn, plotly, etc.).
2. Canvas size: 8 × 8 in, equal aspect.
3. Structure:
   • 8 equal 45° wedges labelled, clockwise from the top:  
     “REFORMER”, “DIRECTOR”, “MOTIVATOR”, “INSPIRER”,  
     “HELPER”, “SUPPORTER”, “COORDINATOR”, “OBSERVER”.  
     - Label text sits on the coloured outer rim, curved along the arc.  
     - Rim colours (hex):  
       Reformer #AF6BAA, Director #E15736, Motivator #F28E2B, Inspirer #F1C84C,  
       Helper #D5D95D, Supporter #7EB758, Coordinator #1B8673, Observer #4576A8.
4. Concentric rings:
   • 4 radii → 3 gray “score” bands plus the white centre.  
   • Alternate gray/white fill starting with light-gray (#ECECEC) for the outermost band.  
   • Bold black circle outlines at each radius.
5. Radial guides:
   • Solid black lines on the 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° axes.  
   • Dashed black guides at 22.5° increments (i.e., the bisectors of each wedge).
6. Cell numbers:
   • Load the 4 × 8 integer grid below and place each number centred in its cell:  

     ```python
     data = [
         [  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8],   # outermost ring
         [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 108, 109, 112],   # second ring
         [121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 128, 129, 132],   # third ring
         [141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 148, 149, 152]    # innermost score ring
     ]
     ```
7. Central DISC quartered circle: four equal quadrants (top-left blue #2B70B6, top-right red #E13A3E, bottom-left green #9BB53C, bottom-right yellow #F4D35E) with a thin black outline.
8. Two miniature pie charts:
   • First pie: centre at polar (θ = 22.5°, r ≈ 0.55 × max) with 4 slices [0.35, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15] and matching blue/red/green/yellow colours; draw a black 1-pt outline around each wedge.  
   • Second pie: centre at polar (θ = 67.5°, r ≈ 0.85 × max) with slices [0.45, 0.30, 0.15, 0.10] and same colours.
9. Automatically hide axes, ticks, and frame.
10. Save figure to “disc_wheel.png”.

Be sure to:
- Build polar coordinates manually with matplotlib.patches.Wedge for full control.  
- Wrap repetitive wedge drawing in helper functions.  
- Keep code under 150 lines and include clear inline comments.
- Put all magic numbers (radii, colours, labels) as named constants at the top.

Return only the Python source code, nothing else.
